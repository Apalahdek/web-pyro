This is the repository for the pyro.host marketing website. Pyro is a game hosting service that makes it easier to play your favorite games with friends. We have decided to open-source our website as we believe in transparency, openness, and free (as in beer, and as in speech!) software.

## Building
You must have the latest Node LTS and a working installation of pnpm. Clone the repository, then run
```sh
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
to run the development server.

## Contributions
We won't be accepting contributions typically for the first few months of our release. We're still a new company and we'd like to keep focus on developing the best product before allowing community contributions! However, anyone is free to use the repository under the License terms.
